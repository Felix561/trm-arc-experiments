  "slug": "trm_structured_prefix_program_embeddings_negative",
  "status": "negative_or_inconclusive",
  "summary": "We tested structured prefix slot factorization (UUID + augmentation slots + base-task slots) to encourage more shared task representations across augmentations. Under our explored settings, gains were not reliable and metrics were mostly flat-to-worse versus baseline.",
  "compute_caveat": "Many runs were compute-limited (often short-to-mid length, e.g. ~30k-50k steps), so this should be interpreted as directional rather than definitive.",
  "recommended_next_step": "If revisiting, run longer controlled sweeps with fixed evaluation protocol, report per-ablation fingerprints, and test whether improvements emerge only after longer finetune horizons."
